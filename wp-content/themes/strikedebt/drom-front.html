<h1>The Debt Resisters&rsquo; Operations Manual</h1>


<div class="intro">

<p>Written by a network of activists, writers, and academics from <a href="http://strikedebt.org">Strike Debt</a>, The Debt Resisters' Operations Manual maps out how the predatory debt system works to increase inequality, undermine democracy, and ruin lives. It provides detailed strategies for fighting common forms of debt and lays out an expansive vision for a societal movement of debt resistance. The full text of the manual is available here for free.</p>

		<h2>Praise for the Manual</h2>

		<figure>
			<p>"That debt is neither inevitable nor ethical is one of the powerful assertions of Strike Debt, whose brilliant manual is both a practical handbook and a manifesto for a true debt jubilee: an economic rebirth in which the indebted are freed and financial institutions are reinvented. It's a stunning intersection of ferocity (against the debt industry) and compassion (for the people whose lives are broken by debt). In years to come, we may look back on it as a landmark in social transformation; right now it is both useful and exhilarating."</p>

			<p class="attr">&mdash;Rebecca Solnit, author of A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities That Arise in Disaster and Wanderlust: A History of Walking</p>
		</figure>
		
		<figure>
			<p>"The impact of the neoliberal assault on the U.S. population in the past generation has rightly been designated a 'failure by design.' This failure is sharply class-based-for the designers it has been a grand success, and a failure for most of the rest. The same is true of debt. That sets two tasks for those who care about the health of the society: change the design, and find ways to cope as effectively with the failures it imposes. This valuable monograph by Strike Debt provides a good guide to undertake both."</p>

			<p class="attr">&mdash;Noam Chomsky, author of Hopes and Prospects and Making the Future: The Unipolar Imperial Moment</p>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<p>"This manual is a practical guide that will aid anyone who is struggling with debt. But even more important, it is a political guide that illuminates the myriad kinds of debt relationships that define our society and helps us imagine how we can begin to organize collectively against debt."</p>

			<p class="attr">&mdash;Michael Hardt, coauthor of Commonwealth</p>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<p>"The Debt Resisters' Operations Manual is a powerful tool for resistance and creation. It shows how we can say 'No!' to debt-resist and refuse-while at the same time opens the possibility of alternative ways of relating and creating real value together-based on solidarity and care."</p>

			<p class="attr">&mdash;Marina Sitrin, author of Everyday Revolutions: Horizontalism and Autonomy in Argentina</p>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<p>"The Debt Resisters' Operation Manual is a sober, practical book that will save its readers much money and many sleepless nights. At the same time it is a visionary text that goes into the bowels of the debt machine to chart a collective way out of the state of debt-induced indentured servitude that millions of Americans face. It is the new debt resisters' movement's opening challenge to Wall Street that is making the bankers anxious. Get a copy and join the movement."</p>

			<p class="attr">&mdash;Silvia Federici, author of <em>Revolution at Point Zero and Caliban and the Witch</em>.</p>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<p>The Debt Resisters' Operations Manual is a guide for every debtor living in the United States. Given that more than 75% of American households are in debt right now, its relevance cannot be overstated. The manual is ambitious in subject matter but grounded in tone: plain and clear English is the best weapon if we want to understand the deliberately over-complicated debt economy. Readers learn that personal debt-credit card, medical, student, and housing-is rarely just personal and an important section on municipal debt reclaims the conversation about debt from the Right, where it is used so often to justify austerity. It questions the received wisdom that an indebted city logically must pursue cuts by showing that the money that is now considered 'owed' did not magically disappear; it was transferred to the 1 percent and should be taken back. The authors undo the assumptions that prop up the debt economy and challenge the notion that repaying debts is a moral duty; in fact, they argue, debt resistance is the moral choice."</p>
